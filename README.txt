This code contains plots and code covering the Feburary 2018 severe flooding event that impacted the midwest, in particular areas of Northern Indiana, southern Michigan, and northwest Ohio. 

CODE:

All code for this project is located in a python notebook called "Group2_CompMethods.ipynb". Each section of code is responsible for generating its own respective plot. Contained is code for creating a 500 mb map of geopotential heights and precipitable water transport, creating a graphical depiction of river dicharge rates over time, and creating surface maps of forecasted rain accumulation; one map is a 24-hour forecast valid at 06z on Feb. 20, 2018, and the other is also a 24-hour forecast valid 1 day later at 06z on the 21st.
